# tMuslim-Discord-Bot
Discord bot for Server-wide athaans, duaas, Quran, and more! 

tMuslim was a project I took on last Ramadan, however eventually scrapped it due to lack of time. This year, I plan on reviving it and getting it ready for next Ramadan

## Planned Features
* Serverwide Athaans
  * Fill your VCs with the sacred sound of the Islamic Call to Prayer. I plan on giving tMuslim the ability to join VCs for prayer times, and play the Athaan in the VC
* Duaas, Hadiths, and Quran
  * Using a curated set of authentic duaas and hadiths, I plan on making a system where you can request random duaas, hadiths, Quran chapters, etc. and a system where you can select specific Quraan verses/Chapters
* Prayer Times
  * Unlike my previous attempt at a Muslim app - TMMuslim/tMuslim, I plan on making this bot actually work for regions other than the one I currently reside in. That's why I have a fairly rudimentary system setup for servers. I plan on beefind this system up and making it more robust
